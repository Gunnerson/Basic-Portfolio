                I'm a student at the UC Berkeley Full Stack Web Developer Program and an operations project manager at an amazing grocery delivery company called Good Eggs. I'm an award winning operations manager with experience in project management, people operations, recruiting, facilities management, and event production working for startups and software companies. In 2018, I completed a certificate in Product Management from General Assembly and studied Public Relations and Business Administration at Kennesaw State University outside Atlanta, Ga.

                I moved to the San Francisco Bay Area in 2010 where I met my amazing husband Wes and fell into Tech. In my spare time, you'll find me at a local farmers market trying the freshest in-season goodies, shopping for kitchen ingredients and cookware, or at a coffee shop listening to podcasts. I'm an avid reader, kitchen enthusiast, master entertainer and world traveler, having been to 5 counries.
